# Purpose

This application allows a user to create a folder that can be populated with shortened links. Once a folder is created the user clicks the folder and is prompted to enter a title for the url and the url itself. When the links are created they are populated underneath the input fields with a shortened link, title, creation date, and the number of times the link has been visited. The user can then click or copy the link and be redirected to the original link.
